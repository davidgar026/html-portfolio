<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm David, a web developer from Staten Island, New York. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the College of Staten Island, and I'm now channeling my analytical skills into front-end development, with hopes of eventually becoming a full-stack developer. My passion lies in creating practical and impactful web applications, from everyday tools to essential services like GPS apps.</p>

My goal is to leverage my growing knowledge to build innovative solutions and keep pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in technology.</p>
  
<p>As I embark on this journey, I'm excited to share my progress and projects with you. My commitment to continual learning and hands-on experimentation drives me to explore new technologies and techniques. I invite you to follow along as I develop my skills, tackle new challenges, and bring fresh ideas to life. Your support and feedback will be invaluable as I grow in this dynamic field.</p>
